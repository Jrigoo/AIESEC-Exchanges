# AIESEC Exchanges Form
This form serves as a valuable tool for AIESEC in Panama, facilitating the connection of clients to international internship or volunteer opportunities while seamlessly integrating their information into the Podio CRM. The need for this form arose from challenges encountered when participants enrolled in the program, as certain essential details were not captured, hindering the sales process. Global AIESEC relies on a global CRM known as [expa.aiesec.org](https://expa.aiesec.org), but its limitation lies in its inability to be modified, resulting in incomplete lead data during the signup phase.

AIESEC in Panama employs Podio as its CRM to effectively manage the sales funnel and processes. The uniqueness of this form lies in its ability to interface with both Podio and Expa APIs, enabling the registration of leads on both platforms. This integration enhances the capability to gather more specific information about lead interests, ultimately contributing to a more precise and expedited sales experience.
